    <p class="notice">
      Please refrain from using anyone's real names or information that would reveal the identity of anyone referenced in your secret.<br><br>
      Once you submit a secret, it will be reviewed by our little team and once we determine it doesn't unclude derogatory language or otherwise create a hostile environment for any viewers or participants, we will add it to the ~secret swirl!~
      <br><br>This form will not record your email address, but we must assume google still somehow links your entry to your email address. So while we (the form hosters) cannot see who you are, we cannot guarantee the same is true for the google peoplew.
